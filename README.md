# Virtual Kimi - AI Companion Application 💖

A sophisticated web-based AI companion featuring adaptive personalities, intelligent memory systems, and immersive conversational experiences.

## Overview

Virtual Kimi is an advanced virtual companion application that combines modern web technologies with state-of-the-art AI models to create meaningful, evolving relationships between users and AI personalities.

- **Lightweight:** ~600 KB of pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (no frameworks)
- **Local-first:** All data is stored in your browser's IndexedDB (managed by Dexie.js)
- **No tracking:** The only external calls are to FontAwesome (for icons) and the OpenRouter API (for AI)

Built with vanilla JavaScript and modern web APIs, it offers a rich, responsive experience across devices.

### Adding New Features

#### Creating a New Plugin

```javascript
// manifest.json
{
    "name": "Custom Theme",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "type": "theme",
    "style": "theme.css",
    "main": "theme.js",

}
```

> **Note:** As of version 1.0, only the color theme plugin is fully functional. Voice and behavior plugins are planned for future releases. See `kimi-plugins/sample-theme/` for a working example.

#### Extending Memory Categories

```javascript
// Add to kimi-memory-system.js
const customCategory = {
    name: "custom",
    icon: "fas fa-star",
    keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
    confidence: 0.7
};
```

### Health Check System

The application includes a comprehensive health check system:

```javascript
// Run health check
const healthCheck = new KimiHealthCheck();
const report = await healthCheck.runAllChecks();
console.log(report.status); // 'HEALTHY' or 'NEEDS_ATTENTION'
```
